Discouraged, the guy goes to his car to sulk when inspiration strikes: He&#039;s got jumper cables in the trunk!

There was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all things mechanical. After serving his company loyally for over 30 years, he happily retired. Several years later the company contacted him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their multi-million dollar machines. They had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail. In desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past.<br />
<br />
The engineer reluctantly took the challenge. He spent a day studying the huge machine. At the end of the day, he marked a small &quot;x&quot; in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated:<br />
<br />
&quot;This is where your problem is.&quot;<br />
<br />
The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service. They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The engineer responded briefly:<br />
<br />
One chalk mark: $1.<br />
<br />
Knowing where to put it: $49,999.<br />
<br />
He was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.

<br />
After dinner, William&#039;s dad took him aside. &quot;Son, I have to talk with you. Your mother and I have been married 30 years. She&#039;s a wonderful wife but she has never offered much excitement in the bedroom, so I used to fool around with women a lot. Susan is actually your half-sister, and I&#039;m afraid you can&#039;t marry her.&quot;<br />

A group of managers were given the assignment to measure the height of a flagpole. So they go out to the flagpole with ladders and tape measures, and they&#039;re falling off the ladders, dropping the tape measures--the whole thing is just a mess. An engineer comes along and sees what they&#039;re trying to do, walks over, pulls the flagpole out of the ground, lays it flat, measures it from end to end, gives the measurement to one of the managers and walks away.<br />
<br />
After the engineer has gone, one manager turns to another and laughs. &quot;Isn&#039;t that just like an engineer? We&#039;re looking for the height and he gives us the length.&quot;

A man piloting a hot air balloon discovers he has wandered off course and is hopelessly lost. He descends to a lower altitude and locates a man down on the ground. He lowers the balloon further and shouts, &quot;Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man below says, &quot;Yes, you&#039;re in a hot air balloon, about 30 feet above this field.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must work in Information Technology,&quot; says the balloonist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do,&quot; replies the man. &quot;And how did you know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; says the balloonist, &quot;what you told me is technically correct, but of no use to anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man below says, &quot;You must work in management.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; replies the balloonist, &quot;how did you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; says the man, &quot;you don&#039;t know where you are, or where you&#039;re going, but you expect my immediate help. You&#039;re in the same position you were before we met, but now it&#039;s my fault!&quot;

This guy&#039;s wife asks, &quot;Honey, if I died would you remarry?&quot; and he replies, &quot;Well, after a considerable period of grieving, we all need companionship, so I guess I would.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then asks, &quot;If I died and you remarried, would she live in this house?&quot; and he replies, &quot;We&#039;ve spent a lot of time and money getting this house just the way we want it. I&#039;m not going to get rid of my house, so I guess she would.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I died and you remarried, and she lived in this house, would she sleep in our bed?&quot; and he says, &quot;That bed is brand new. We just paid two thousand dollars for it, and it&#039;s going to last a long time, so I guess she would.&quot;<br />
<br />
So she asks, &quot;If I died and you remarried, and she lived in this house, and slept in our bed, would she use my golf clubs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, she&#039;s left handed.&quot;

An engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates. St. Peter checks his dossier and says, &quot;Ah, you&#039;&#039;re an engineer--you&#039;re in the wrong place.&quot; So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After awhile, they&#039;ve got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty popular guy. One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, &quot;So, how&#039;s it going down there in hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
Satan replies, &quot;Hey, things are going great. We&#039;ve got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and there&#039;s no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next.&quot;<br />
<br />
God replies, &quot;What?? You&#039;ve got an engineer? That&#039;s a mistake--he should never have gotten down there; send him up here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Satan says, &quot;No way.&quot; I like having an engineer on the staff, and I&#039;m keeping him.&quot;<br />
<br />
God says, &quot;Send him back up here or I&#039;ll sue.&quot;<br />

Satan laughs uproariously and answers, &quot;Yeah, right. And just where are YOU going to get a lawyer?&quot;

Watson replies, &quot;I see millions of stars.&quot; <br />

&quot;You must be an engineer,&quot; said the balloonist.<br />

&quot;I am,&quot; replied the woman. &quot;How did you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; answered the balloonist, &quot;everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is, I am still lost. Frankly, you&#039;ve not been much help so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman below responded, &quot;You must be in management.&quot;<br />

&quot;I am,&quot; replied the balloonist, &quot;but how did you know?&quot; <br />

&quot;Well,&quot; said the woman, &quot;you don&#039;t know where you are or where you are going. You have risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot air. You made a promise that you have no idea how to keep, and you expect people beneath you to solve your problems.

A puzzled expression ran riot over Judy&#039;s face. &quot;An ID Ten T Error? What&#039;s that...in case I need to fix it again?&quot;<br />
<br />
He gave her a grin...&quot;Haven&#039;t you ever heard of an ID Ten T Error before?&quot;<br />

&quot;No,&quot; replied Judy.<br />

An astronomer, a physicist and a mathematician (it is said) were holidaying in Scotland. Glancing from a train window, they observed a black sheep in the middle of a field.<br />
<br />
&quot;How interesting,&quot; observed the astronomer, &quot;All Scottish sheep are black!&quot;<br />
<br />
To which the physicist responded, &quot;No, no! Some Scottish sheep are black!&quot;<br />
<br />
The mathematician gazed heavenward in supplication, and then intoned, &quot;In Scotland there exists at least one field, containing at least one sheep, at least one side of which is black.&quot;

An American tourist goes into a restaurant in Spain and orders the specialty of the house. When his dinner arrives, he asks the waiter what it is. <br />
<br />
&quot;These, senor,&quot; replied the waiter in broken English, &quot;are the testicles of the bull killed in the ring today.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tourist swallowed hard but tasted the dish and thought it was delicious. So he comes back the next evening and orders the same item. When it is served, he says to the waiter, &quot;These testicles...are much smaller than the ones I had last night.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, senor,&quot; replied the waiter, &quot;You see...the bull, he does not always lose.

&quot;Nonsense,&quot; the Frenchman disagrees. &quot;They&#039;re naked, and so beautiful. Clearly, they are French.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way! They have no clothes and no shelter,&quot; the Russian points out, &quot;They have only an apple to eat, and they are being told they live in a paradise. Obviously, they are Russian.&quot;

A little boy goes to his dad and asks, &quot;What is politics?&quot;<br />
<br />
His dad says, &quot;Well son, let me try to explain it this way: I&#039;m the breadwinner of the family, so let&#039;s call me capitalism. Your Mom, she&#039;s the administrator of the money, so we&#039;ll call her the government. We&#039;re here to take care of your needs, so we&#039;ll call you the people. The nanny, we&#039;ll consider her the working class. And your baby brother, we&#039;ll call him the future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents&#039; room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny&#039;s room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, &quot;Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now.&quot; The father says, &quot;Good, son. Tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.&quot;<br />
<br />
The little boy replies, &quot;Well, while capitalism is screwing the working class, the government is sound asleep, the people are being ignored and the future is in deep shit.&quot;

An American, a Scot and a Canadian were in a terrible car accident. They were all brought to the same emergency room, but all three of them died before they arrived.<br />
<br />
Just as they were about to put the toe tag on the American, he stirred and opened his eyes. Astonished, the doctors and nurses present asked him what happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said the American, &quot;I remember the crash, and then there was a beautiful light, and then the Canadian and the Scot and I were standing at the gate s of heaven. St. Peter approached us and said that we were all to young to die, and that for a donation of $50, we could return to earth. So of course I pulled out my wallet and gave him the $50, and the next thing I knew I was back here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#039;s amazing!&quot; said the one of the doctors, &quot;But what happened to the other two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Last I saw them,&quot; replied the American, &quot;the Scot was haggling over the price and the Canadian was waiting for the government to pay his.&quot;

A group of girlfriends is on vacation when they see a 5-story hotel with a sign that reads: &quot;For Women Only.&quot; Since they are without their boyfriends and husbands, they decide to go in. <br />
<br />
The bouncer, a very attractive guy, explains to them how it works. &quot;We have 5 floors. Go up floor by floor, and once you find what you are looking for, you can stay there. It&#039;s easy to decide since each floor has a sign telling you what&#039;s inside.&quot; <br />
<br />
So they start going up and on the first floor the sign reads: &quot;All the men on this floor are short and plain.&quot; The friends laugh and without hesitation move on to the next floor. <br />
<br />
The sign on the second floor reads: &quot;All the men here are short and handsome.&quot; Still, this isn&#039;t good enough, so the friends continue on up. <br />
<br />
They reach the third floor and the sign reads: &quot;All the men here are tall and plain.&quot; <br />
<br />
They still want to do better, and so, knowing there are still two floors left, they continued on up. <br />
<br />
On the fourth floor, the sign is perfect: &quot;All the men here are tall and handsome.&quot; The women get all excited and are going in when they realize that there is still one floor left. Wondering what they are missing, they head on up to the fifth floor. <br />
<br />
There they find a sign that reads: &quot;There are no men here. This floor was built only to prove that there is no way to please a woman.&quot;

He went there, lay on the couch, spilled his guts then waited for the profound wisdom of the psychiatrist to make him feel better.<br />

The psychiatrist asked me a few questions, took some notes then sat thinking in silence for a few minutes with a puzzled look on his face.<br />
<br />
He looked up with an expression of delight and said, &quot;I think your problem is low self-esteem. It is very common among losers.&quot;

A man is driving in the country one evening when his car stalls and won&#039;t start. He goes up to a nearby farm house for help, and because it is suppertime he is asked to stay for supper. When he sits down at the table he notices that a pig is sitting at the table with them for supper and that the pig has a wooden leg.<br />
<br />
As they are eating and chatting, he eventually asks the farmer why the pig is there and why it has a wooden leg.<br />
<br />&quot;Oh,&quot; says the farmer, &quot;that is a very special pig. Last month my wife and daughter were in the barn when it caught fire. The pig saw this, ran to the barn, tipped over a pail of water, crawled over the wet floor to reach them and pulled them out of the barn safely. A special pig like that, you just don&#039;t eat it all at once!&quot;

It was the day of the big sale. Rumors of the sale (and some advertising in the local paper) were the main reason for the long line that formed by 8:30, the store&#039;s opening time, in front of the store.<br />
<br />
A small man pushed his way to the front of the line, only to be pushed back, amid loud and colorful curses. On the man&#039;s second attempt, he was punched square in the jaw, and knocked around a bit, and then thrown to the end of the line again. As he got up the second time, he said to the person at the end of the line...<br />

Recently a teacher, a garbage collector, and a lawyer wound up together at the Pearly Gates. St. Peter informed them that in order to get into Heaven, they would each have to answer one question. <br />
<br />
St. Peter addressed the teacher and asked, &quot;What was the name of the ship that crashed into the iceberg? They just made a movie about it.&quot; <br />
<br />
The teacher answered quickly, &quot;That would be the Titanic.&quot; St. Peter let him through the gate. <br />
<br />
St. Peter turned to the garbage man and, figuring Heaven didn&#039;t really need all the odors that this guy would bring with him, decided to make the question a little harder: &quot;How many people died on the ship?&quot; <br />
<br />
Fortunately for him, the trash man had just seen the movie. &quot;1,228,&quot; he answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#039;s right! You may enter.&quot;<br />

In an interview with David Letterman, Carter passed along an anecdote of a translation problem in Japan. Carter was speaking at a business lunch in Tokyo, where he decided to open his speech with a brief joke.<br />
<br />
He told the joke, then waited for the translator to announce the Japanese version. Even though the story was quite short, Carter was surprised by how quickly the interpreter was able to re-tell it. Even more impressive was the reaction from the crowd. Carter thought the story was cute, but not outright hilarious, yet the crowd broke right up. Carter was very flattered.<br />
<br />
After the speech, Carter wanted to meet the translator to ask him how he told the joke. Perhaps there is better way to tell the joke?<br />
<br />
When Carter asked how the joke had been told in Japanese, the translator responded, &quot;I told them, &#039;President Carter has told a very funny joke. Please laugh now.&#039;&quot;
